# PerFit


PerFit! is a matchmaking platform - yes, matchmaking - for startups and students. Heard of too many job-matching platforms? PerFit isn't just another JobStreet. Why it is a 'matchmaking' platform is because on PerFit, everything is a two-way communication. 


The days of filling in hundreds of applications only to check your email every morning and finding no 'Congratulations!' emails are over. As a student, simply express your interest in a company with a simple tap of a button, then wait for a company to send you an offer. Coolbeans. 


Tired of seeing competent students flock to FAANG? You will never have to bare your fangs at them again with PerFit. On PerFit, every startup has an equal chance of hiring the most able jobseeker you can find. Found the student with that A+++ and an impossible number of referrals? Ready, set, shoot that offer button. 





Instructions for you to get started on PerFit:


1. Install the latest version of Flutter and Dart on your device if you have not done so
2. Download/clone PerFit repository: https://github.com/kkangs0226/PerFit
3. Type in command 'flutter pub get' in terminal to get the relevant packages you need 
4. Run the app on a simulator and you're all set. 



Wishing all of you good luck on finding your PerFit match!
